I joined the open house to explore tech opportunities and learn the basics of web development. I want to gain new skills that can help me find a better job and build my future.

I worked in a restaurant where I took orders, served food, and helped customers. It taught me to work hard, be patient, and do my best even when itâ€™s busy.
